        Facebook, now known as Meta, was founded by Mark Zuckerberg in 2004. It
        started as a social networking platform for college students, but
        quickly expanded to the public. With over 2.8 billion monthly active
        users, it became one of the world's largest social media platforms.
        Facebook has evolved by acquiring Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus, and
        has shifted its focus toward developing the "metaverse." It plays a
        central role in digital advertising, using sophisticated algorithms to
        target ads based on user data.
