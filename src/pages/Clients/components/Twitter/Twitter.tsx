        Twitter, founded in 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams,
        is a microblogging platform that allows users to post short messages
        called "tweets" (up to 280 characters). It became famous for its
        real-time nature, where breaking news, trends, and conversations unfold
        quickly. With its use of hashtags, Twitter has played a key role in
        social movements, politics, and global discussions. It was acquired by
        Elon Musk in 2022. Known for its influence in shaping public opinion and
        news cycles, Twitter has over 400 million monthly active users.
